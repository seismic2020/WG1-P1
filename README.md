# WG1-P1
The official code repository of SEISMIC working group 1, project 1.

## Organization
Our goal is to use the **analysis** and **tools** folders to share code among collaborators from different institutions. As such, the code should adhere to the common data model that is currently housed elsewhere (see the Wiki). Analysis scripts are meant to be specific to tasks for the project, while the tools will hopefully be broadly useful to others outside the project.
Most users will find what they need in the analysis folder. 

Collaborators that want to can form their own institution-specific folders with material to be shared among their local colleagues, or perhaps results. 

## Tool To-Dos
- Code to map ACT to SAT and the reverse. Tables exist in an SAT/ACT subfolder that are a start.
- Convert networks scripts to common data model
- Convert course vectors scripts to common data model
